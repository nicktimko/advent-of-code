# Advent of Code 2020
in Python and Rust

## Python

I know this language well, so using it as a reference.

```
‚ùØ python -m aopy20 1 --time
Part 1: 935419
Part 2: 49880012
Elapsed time: 0.19 ms
```

Generic helpers are `aopy20.io`, days are split into modules under `aopy20.days.dNN`,
which are dynamically loaded based on the first integer argument to the program.

## Rust

Learning this.
