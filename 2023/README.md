# 2023 Advent of Code with Rust

I worked with Rust before, but didn't do much. Maybe more this year? I'm coming back with not much real knowledge beyond "Rust has variable ownership", and mostly from Python and Golang experience, so I'll write from that perspective.

## Log

### Day 1

Looking through [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) it's [file I/O section](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std_misc/file.html) is buried behind "std misc"? Strange. Was going to work on creating basic file I/O readers, but will maybe do that later.
